          <p>Dear MR.Flintstone</p>
          <p>
            I am writing you concerning a recent purchase of promotional items.
            Approximately two weeks ago, on May 1, I ordered a total of 500
            promotional items for Company, Inc. via the Promotional items
            webpage. I received an email notification within three hours
            confirming the receipt of payment via credit card and the prompt
            shipment of promotional items. Your website indicated, shipments
            should reach their destination within 3-5 business days of being
            sent, but I am eagerly awaiting to receive the promotional items. Do
            you have any information on what may have happened with shipment or
            where the shipment is located?
          </p></i

            I have worked with name of company before and have confidence in
            your product lines and excellent customer service. The shipment of
            promotional items must arrive soon, and I hoped you might be able to
            provide me with an idea of when I can receive them in our office.
            Thank you in advance for assistance you may provide regarding the
            purchase.
          </p></i
